Section 3.2-3.4 Draft Answers (Q5-Q17)

Q5: petitioner_vote is binary and fairly balanced but slightly petitioner-leaning: mean = 0.545, median = 1. pitch_diff is centered near zero (mean = -0.074, median = -0.044) but has an extreme lower-tail outlier (min = -20.325, max = 3.846). petitioner_harvard_pos is right-skewed (mean = 9.222, median = 7, max = 90). There are 232 missing values in petitioner_harvard_pos and related text variables, so complete-case models drop observations.

Q6: pitch_diff is measured as petitioner_pitch minus respondent_pitch and captures whether a justice spoke at higher or lower pitch to one side relative to the other. Supplemental documentation indicates the pitch measure is standardized before differencing, which helps comparability across speakers (e.g., men vs. women with different baseline pitch ranges) and reduces sensitivity to absolute-frequency measurement noise. petitioner_harvard_pos is constructed by counting words directed to the petitioner that match a predefined Harvard-IV positive-word dictionary. A challenge is that dictionary methods ignore context: sarcasm, negation, legal jargon, and polysemy can cause words to be counted as 'positive' even when tone is neutral or negative.

Q7: Dictionary-based coding can introduce false positives (words marked positive in neutral/legal context), false negatives (missed positive phrasing not in the dictionary), and context errors (negation, irony, sarcasm). These measurement errors generally add noise and can attenuate coefficients toward zero, but if misclassification is systematic by justice, issue area, or period, it can also bias effect estimates and distort substantive interpretation.

Q8: Across all three chief justices, petitioner-win rates are higher when the Solicitor General supports the petitioner. JGRoberts: 0.552 (No Amicus) -> 0.772 (Amicus), delta = 0.220; WEBurger: 0.625 (No Amicus) -> 0.818 (Amicus), delta = 0.193; WHRehnquist: 0.567 (No Amicus) -> 0.754 (Amicus), delta = 0.186 A plausible interpretation is that SG support signals legal merit and institutional credibility, but the pattern may also reflect case selection and omitted confounders.

Q9: Higher pitch-difference observations are generally associated with lower petitioner-win rates in Rehnquist and Roberts periods, while the Burger period shows little difference. Burger: Above = 0.619, Below = 0.645, delta(Above-Below) = -0.026; Rehnquist: Above = 0.583, Below = 0.658, delta(Above-Below) = -0.075; Roberts: Above = 0.573, Below = 0.650, delta(Above-Below) = -0.077 This suggests the pitch-vote relationship is not constant over time and appears stronger in later court periods.

Q10: In the baseline model (m3_1), pitch_diff is negative and statistically significant (b = -0.057, p = 4.81e-13), implying higher petitioner-vs-respondent pitch is associated with a lower probability of a petitioner vote. pr_petitioner_pos is not statistically significant (b = 0.041, p = 0.796), so lexical positivity differences do not show a clear linear association in this specification.

Q11: Controlling for justice fixed effects is important because justices have persistent baseline voting tendencies that can confound speech-effect estimates. After adding justice controls, adjusted R2 rises from 0.010 to 0.016, and 6 justice indicators are significant at p < 0.05. The pitch_diff estimate remains negative and similar in magnitude, indicating the relationship is not driven only by cross-justice composition.

Q12: Adding term indicators further increases adjusted R2 from 0.016 to 0.038, with 6 term indicators significant at p < 0.05. This indicates nontrivial time-period variation in voting behavior and better overall fit once period-specific shocks are absorbed.

Q13: In the pitch_diff * court_period interaction model, the negative slope is strongest in the Rehnquist period and also negative in the Roberts period: Burger slope = -0.017, Rehnquist slope = -0.073, Roberts slope = -0.057. This supports a period-varying relationship where vocal-pitch effects are modest in Burger-era data and more negative afterward.

Q14: Progressive models show small fit gains from Model 1 to 2, a clearer jump when sgpetac is added (Model 3), and minor incremental changes from additional period and interaction terms. Adjusted R2 values are: M1=0.010, M2=0.010, M3=0.024, M4=0.023, M5=0.024, M6=0.024. Substantively, SG amicus support is the strongest added predictor in this set, while interaction terms modestly refine but do not radically change model fit.

Q15: IGNORE/DO NOT ANSWER.

Q16: Using assignment thresholds, 244 observations are flagged by at least one diagnostic and 0 are egregious (all four criteria). Top flagged observations include: obs 117 (1988-124-01, HABlackmun, term 1988, flags=3); obs 4683 (2013-020-01, JGRoberts, term 2013, flags=3); obs 82 (1985-082-01, WEBurger, term 1985, flags=3); obs 461 (1998-050-01, AScalia, term 1998, flags=3); obs 12 (1982-129-01, WEBurger, term 1982, flags=3). Most high-impact cases are flagged by leverage, Cook's D, and DFFITS simultaneously, while none exceed the |studentized residual| > 2 rule.

Q17: Removing flagged outliers changes some coefficients but preserves the core qualitative finding that pitch_diff remains negative and SG amicus support remains positive/significant. pitch_diff: b -0.056 -> -0.088; SE 0.008 -> 0.011 sgpetac: b 0.143 -> 0.144; SE 0.017 -> 0.018 pitch_diff:pr_petitioner_pos: b -0.156 -> -0.252; SE 0.124 -> 0.303 The clean-sample model has similar directional conclusions but somewhat different magnitudes and uncertainty, so results look broadly robust with moderate sensitivity for interaction terms.

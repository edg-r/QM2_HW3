Section 3.1 Draft Answers (Q1-Q4)

Q1: This dataset contains 5209 justice-level observations across 1002 unique dockets (1000 unique case IDs) and 18 justices. Each row includes vote outcomes (petitioner_vote), oral-argument speech measures (including pitch_diff), and case context such as term and amicus variables. This structure supports testing whether oral-argument emotional cues are associated with Supreme Court voting behavior.

Q2: The unit of observation is one justice-docket vote record. docketId + justiceName combinations are unique in this dataset (duplicates = 0), which is consistent with that unit.

Q3: A vote in favor of the petitioner is coded as petitioner_vote = 1. This is substantively important because these votes determine case outcomes and legal precedent. The assignment uses this outcome to evaluate whether emotional dynamics in oral argument relate to judicial decisions.

Q4: There are 5568 missing values in total. 24 variables have missing data, and each has 232 missing observations (4.45% of rows). Missingness matters because complete-case estimation can reduce sample size and potentially bias results if missingness is non-random.
